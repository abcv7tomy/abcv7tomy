👋 Hi, I’m @abcv7tomy

👀 I’m interested in computer science and am a student in this field. I am honored to have discovered this website and am eager to explore the projects on GitHub. I hope to build upon open-source code and create something new.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python at school and have previously studied front-end technologies such as Vue.js and JavaScript. I am also interested in learning more about C language for future career opportunities in game development or software development.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to my interests and skills.

📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via email at 3040333412@qq.com. Thank you!
